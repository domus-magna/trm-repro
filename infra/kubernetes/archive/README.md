# Archived Kubernetes Configurations

This folder retains legacy manifests and scripts that were part of earlier TRM operations
(dataset builders, one-off 12 GPU experiments, PVC helpers, etc). They are preserved only
for historical reference—the current, supported jobs live one directory up under
`infra/kubernetes/`.

None of the files here are used in the paper-faithful ARC-AGI-2 reproduction flows; feel
free to ignore them unless you are digging into operational history.
